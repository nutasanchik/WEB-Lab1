                Batman ventures into Gotham City's underworld when a sadistic killer
                leaves behind a trail of cryptic clues. As the evidence begins to
                lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator's plans become
                clear, he must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit and bring
                justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued the
                metropolis.

                Street-smart thief Nathan Drake is recruited by seasoned
                treasure hunter Victor "Sully" Sullivan to recover a
                fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. What starts as a
                heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to
                reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada, who believes he and his
                family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the
                clues and solve one of the world's oldest mysteries,
                they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate's
                long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together.

            <div class="description">
                One of the most compelling and conflicted characters in Sony Pictures
                Universe of Marvel Characters comes to the big screen as Oscar winner
                Jared Leto transforms into the enigmatic antihero Michael Morbius.
                Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save
                others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.
                While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him
                is unleashed. Will good override evil -- or will Morbius succumb to his
                mysterious new urges?
